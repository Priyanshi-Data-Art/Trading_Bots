This is a small python project where I connected to Binance Futures Testnet using API keys and placed orders from python code. 
Main purpose of this project was to understand how real trading APIs work.

## Tech Stack:-

## Logs:- All order response stored in trading_bot.log file to debug the error 

## Note:- I used demo/testnet api of binance, no real money used
